## Introduction
In the Project Workspace, I used my skills about Spark MLlib to tackle with predicting churn problem in Sparkify.
The project involved:
  - Manipulate (load, clean, group) data with Pyspark
  - Do EDA to understand data and find pattern of churned user
  - Use Pyspark MLlib to do feature engineering, training and tuning model

## Result Summary
- Understand the pattern of churned user
- Understand how to do preprocess and feature engineering with Pyspark
- Archive Random Forest model which has high accuracy and F1 of 0.85
