## Introduction
In this project, [Stack Overflow Survey Data 2021](https://info.stackoverflowsolutions.com/rs/719-EMH-566/images/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2021.zip) is collected and investigated.
The business questions we are trying to answer the questions
1. What do people do when they get stuck on a problem?
2. What is the language you want to work with most ?
3. What is the best age to start learning coding (to become a professional developer) ?

## Result Summary
After analyzing data, these are the conclussion I found:
1. When people get stuck, around 70% of survey target try to find solution, and the remain 30% do relax and solve it later. When they try to find solution, they often seek help via Google or Stack Overflow.
2. Top 10 languages that are wanted to work with most
```
1. JavaScript
2. Python
3. HTML/CSS
4. TypeScript
5. SQL
6. Node.js
7. C#
8. Java
9. Rust
10. Go
```
3. The best time to start learning code is from 11 years old to 34 years old. And the second best time is now.
